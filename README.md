## Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning methodology used to group and identify similar observations when we do not have labels that identify the groups. It is often employed as a preprocessing or exploratory step in the data science pipeline.

## Use Cases

Clustering has a wide range of use cases across multiple industries, including but not limited to:

1. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics for targeted marketing.
2. **Image Segmentation:** Identifying regions with similar colors or textures in image processing.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Detecting unusual behavior or errors in data.
4. **Recommendation Systems:** Building personalized recommendation engines.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Grouping similar documents, words, or phrases.
6. **Genomic Data Analysis:** Identifying patterns and subgroups in genomic data.
7. **Fraud Detection:** Identifying patterns of fraudulent behavior in financial transactions.
8. **Network Analysis:** Detecting communities or groups in social networks.

## Common Clustering Algorithms

Several clustering algorithms are commonly used:

1. **K-Means Clustering:** Partitions data into K clusters based on distance.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters.
3. **DBSCAN:** Identifies clusters based on data density.
4. **Agglomerative Clustering:** Hierarchical clustering starting with individual data points.

## Implementing K-Means Clustering in Python

This repository provides examples and tutorials on implementing K-Means clustering in Python using libraries like Scikit-Learn and SciPy. The process involves initializing centroids, assigning data points, updating centroids, and repeating until convergence.

## Handling Outliers

Outliers can significantly affect clustering results. Learn how to use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and remove outliers before clustering.

## Scaling Data

Scaling features is essential to prevent dominance by larger scales. Explore common scaling methods, including Standardization and Min-Max scaling.

## Dealing with Missing Values

Missing values can also impact clustering. Discover strategies for imputing missing values or using clustering methods that handle missing data gracefully.

## Plotting Clusters

Visualization is crucial for understanding clustering results. Learn how to create scatter plots and other visualizations to explore cluster characteristics.

## Using Discovered Clusters

Once clusters are identified, explore how to use them for targeted marketing, anomaly detection, personalized recommendations, and more in downstream data science tasks.
